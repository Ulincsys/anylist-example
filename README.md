# AnyList Example

This simple example provides a proof-of-concept of Java's dynamic return types by implementing
a doubly linked list that can store any type of object and then retrieve that object with 
it's original type intact, without the need to explicitly cast the return value. 


### TODO

This example currently doesn't support most of the operations provided by a standard linked
list data structure. Implementation still required:
* Get by index
* Delete
* Find
* Iterator
* Size
